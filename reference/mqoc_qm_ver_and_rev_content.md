* **Note on the release model for IBM MQ on Cloud:**
  * The MQ on Cloud service follows the "Continuous Delivery" (CD) model which means that all queue managers (including those deployed on MQ v9.1.0) will be upgraded to the next CD version within a defined period of time after the next CD version becomes available.
  * In particular the MQ on Cloud service treats MQ v9.1.0 as a CD version and not a "Long Term Support" (LTS) version.

* Automated restart of MQ Web Console process in the event of a failure.
* Enhance the naming format of the diagnostic logs download file to make the queue manager and timezone obvious to enable the file to be more useful once it has been downloaded - e.g. log_QM1_010518_0927Z.zip.

* Ensure that expired logs and diagnostic files, collected from the IBM Cloud user interface, are deleted after 7 days.
* MQ Web Console configuration updates to the default view (title changed and reordering of widgets).
* Improved performance when querying the queue manager status from the IBM Cloud user interface.
* Ability to trigger the starting of a channel when a message arrives on the transmit queue.
