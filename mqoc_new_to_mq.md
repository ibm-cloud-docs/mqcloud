# Introduction To MQ
{: #mqoc_new_to_mq}

* IBM MQ provides proven, enterprise-grade messaging capabilities, such as point-to-point and publish/subscribe models, to facilitate the flow of information between applications.
* This cloud service enables you to use IBM MQ as a managed offering. The IBM Cloud handles upgrades, patches, and many of the operational management tasks on your behalf, so you can focus on integrating IBM MQ with your applications
* As well as this managed cloud service, IBM MQ is available in a wide range of other customer-managed deployment form factors including software installations on Linux, Windows and other platforms, Docker containers, Kubernetes and IBM Cloud Private, the MQ Appliance (physical hardware device) and on the IBM z/OS mainframe
