# Administering a queue manager using IBM MQ Console
{: #mqoc_admin_mqweb}

The MQ Web Console is an administration tool for IBM MQ that you access using a web browser running on your own machine.

With the MQ Web Console, you can create a new queue, put a message onto the queue, browse the queue to view the message, and delete the queue.

* You have permission to access queue managers within your IBM MQ service instance (for instructions, follow the [configuring administrator access for a queue manager](/docs/services/mqcloud?topic=mqcloud-tut_mqoc_configure_admin_qm_access) guide).

7. Make a note of your **MQ Username** for future use.
  * Note that you can edit your **MQ Username** at any time by following the [Editing or removing the MQ username for an existing user or application](/docs/services/mqcloud?topic=mqcloud-mqoc_administer_mq_username) guide.
8. If you do not already have an existing IBM Cloud API key:
  * Click **Create IBM Cloud API Key**.
  * Click **Show** to display the API key to copy and save it for later, or click **Download** to store the API key in a file.
    * Note that the API key generated in these steps is used to authenticate with **IBM Cloud** as the **user** who created it.  Therefore, it should not be shared with any other users and should be stored securely.
    * An API key created through the IBM MQ service can be reset from the queue manager **Administration** tab.
  * Click **Close**.
9. Click **Launch MQ Console**, this will open the 'IBM MQ Web Console' in a new browser tab.
  * Note that the **Launch MQ Console** button will only be available when the queue manager is running and you have an existing IBM Cloud API key.
